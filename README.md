# Regression-Analysis-on-Student-Performance
Regression Analysis using R with more statistical approach on a dataset that describes Student Performance.


In this project, I will perform regression analysis, from a more statistical point of view, on a student dataset containing
multiple types of variables, in order to study their relationship and be able to predict student performance e.i grades.

In order to achieve the task, the project is divided to multiple parts:
1-EDA and Descriptive Statistics
2-Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
3-Feature Engineering and Feature Selection
4-ANOVA test
5-Simple Regression Analysis + Evaluation
6-Multiple Regression Analysis + Evaluation

All the work is done using R language, and then reported in markdown file.
